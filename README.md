# RIYADTECH
A mobile app concept designed to connect startups, investors, and innovators in Saudi Arabia’s growing tech landscape.

# Project Overview

RIYADTECH is a proposed mobile application that aims to address the fragmentation in Saudi Arabia’s tech ecosystem by creating a centralized platform where startups, investors, and innovators can connect and collaborate. The app offers accessible services, strategic networking, and inclusivity across industries and regions.

This project was developed as part of the Mobile App Engineering course and focuses on planning, UI design, and conceptual modeling using Flutter.

# Problem Statement

Despite Saudi Arabia’s growth in technology and innovation, the ecosystem remains fragmented. There is no unified platform that brings together key players such as early-stage startups, experienced innovators, and potential investors. This leads to:

	• Missed investment opportunities
	• Delayed market entry
	• Inefficient collaboration
	• Weak visibility for underrepresented regions and sectors

# Solution Goals

RIYADTECH seeks to:

	• Facilitate Startup Growth by providing visibility and mentorship
	• Boost Investor Engagement with targeted matching algorithms
	• Streamline Innovation Development by enabling collaboration with innovators
	• Foster Regional & Sectoral Inclusivity
	• Support Vision 2030 and align with national transformation goals

 # Platform Pages
 
	• Sign In / Sign Up: Secure user onboarding for both startups and investors
	• Home: Highlights trending ideas, recommended startups, and ecosystem news
	• Profile: Allows users to manage personal info, projects, and connection status
	• About Us: Introduces the platform’s mission and functionality
	• Support Page: Offers help via email, phone, and a contact form
	• Terms of Use: Legal agreement covering privacy, liability, and platform rules

 # Features
 
	• Structured UI design using Flutter
	• Multiple user roles (Startup / Investor / Innovator)
	• Modular architecture for future expansion
	• Static frontend screens demonstrating main flows and page layout
	• Use case-based navigation and interaction structure

#  Technologies Used
 
	• Flutter – for cross-platform UI design
	• Dart – as the programming language
	• Figma / Flowcharts – for UI planning and logic modeling

Note: Backend functionality (authentication, database, APIs) not implemented.

# Use Cases

Each page in the app corresponds to a defined use case:
	• Login & Signup: Users authenticate using email/password
	• Profile Page: Edit profile, toggle status, manage ideas
	• Support Page: Contact help or access FAQ resources
	• Terms of Use: Read and accept legal conditions
	• Home Page: Explore trending projects and news
	• About Us: Learn more about the app and its purpose

# Flowchart

The system checks for logical compatibility between:
	• Startups (industry, funding stage)
	• Investors (focus, funding preferences)
	• Innovators (expertise, collaboration history)

Matching is determined based on predefined logic and property alignment.
