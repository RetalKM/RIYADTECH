# RIYADTECH
Contributed to the front-end design of RIYADTECH, a Flutter-based mobile app concept for connecting startups and investors in Saudi Arabia. Designed three static UI screens (Sign In, Sign Up, Terms of Use) with clean layouts and smooth navigation. The project focused on interface design only, without backend functionality.
